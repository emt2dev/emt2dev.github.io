          <h3>⚕️ Electronic Health Record</h3>
          <p>Back in 2023, I joined a healthcare company as the sole developer on a project that had been running since
            2021. The goal was ambitious: replace a legacy SharePoint-based EHR with a cloud-native application. Because
            of staffing shortages, I stepped in to take the project from half-finished to production-ready.</p>

          <p>One of my first responsibilities was to implement HL7 and FHIR integrations with pharmacies, laboratories,
            and the USMS service for correctional healthcare. I built a custom HL7 encoder/decoder using generics, which
            allowed me to move quickly without sacrificing performance.</p>

          <p>Since I knew my contract would end once the project was complete, I also focused on leaving the system
            maintainable. I introduced automated end-to-end testing using TestCafe (frontend) and XUnit (backend). On
            top of that, I designed and implemented the entire UI/UX using a pre-purchased admin dashboard as a base.
          </p>

          <p>After integrations and UI were working, I tackled database performance. At that point, fetching just ten
            patient records took over 35 seconds. By introducing database-side pagination with stored procedures and
            switching to a more efficient ORM, I reduced that to under one second.</p>

          <p>Authentication was another major challenge. The existing system simply wasn’t functional—logins failed, and
            registrations broke. When I dug deeper, I discovered that during demos the Solution Architect would manually
            add rows to the database on their local machine so logins “appeared” to work. That approach might have
            looked fine in front of stakeholders, but it was completely insecure and not production-ready. I replaced it
            with a proper identity system using Microsoft Identity, Entra ID/Active Directory, and MFA.</p>

          <p>At the same time, I built an automated SFTP process for HL7 file exchange with correctional pharmacies. I
            split my days—SFTP during business hours, security refactoring at night. Not everyone was happy about that,
            but it was the right thing to do.</p>

          <p>As deadlines approached, cost discussions surfaced. The company projected over $400K annually in Azure SQL
            Server storage. When I asked why, the answer was: “we don’t know another way.” I proposed migrating to Azure
            MySQL, drawing on past experience. The move cut projected costs nearly in half (~$207K annually) and I got
            the greenlight to implement it for the EHR platform and since my purview was specific to the new EHR, all I
            had to do was wipe out debugging data (was planned to do anyways) while the IT department would write the
            migration scripts from MSSQL Server to MySQL.</p>

          <p>Not every moment was smooth. For example, I’d see pull requests approved, only for code to be silently
            rewritten later (one example was taking a generics repository (one single file that could be used with many
            files) and having it rewritten for every single entity (one file became 35 with no specific changes)).
            In one demo, I realized the company planned on deploying the application Azure placeholder URL instead of
            buying an actual domain. Finally, I noticed that the closer I got to the completion date, some of my tests were removed.
            Still, I kept focused on delivery.</p>

          <p>Along the lines of the application's performance, it was discovered the SA had placed everything on
            different Azure servers: the database was in one region, the API in a different region (on Azure) separate
            from the client (the UI), was deploying the API in a development state instead of building for production.
            By speaking with the company's Director of IT, I was successful in solving the potential issue of not having
            a working application in the event one Azure region is unavaialble. After fixing these small changes, I was
            happy with the the application.</p>

          <p>After seven months, the platform was finally complete. I deployed it to Azure, handed over master user
            accounts, and closed out my contract. A week later, one of the pharmacies using my HL7 integration reached
            out and invited me to help build their startup.</p>

          <h3>💹 Online Quote Diary (Internal Tool)</h3>

          <p>In early 2025, I was recruited and relocated to Lakeland, FL to take on a project the company had been
            struggling with for nearly a decade. The goal was to replace a vendor-built quoting application that cost
            over $500,000 annually and was no longer supported. With a major deadline looming for User Acceptance
            Testing (August 2025), I was brought in to help turn things around.</p>

          <p>The company operated more like a traditional corporation than a startup. Simple questions required
            meetings, conference rooms, and multiple stakeholders which was not exactly ideal for a project already
            years behind. I leaned on my experience as an EMT to cut through the chaos, and get the critical information
            directly from the people who had it without them realizing.</p>

          <p>What I found was concerning. The web team hadn’t pushed anything new to production in ten whole years. The
            lead frontend developer was building a dynamic form builder (instead of the seven distinct pages the
            business requested) and there was a decision made for “job security,” not efficiency. The backend lead, with
            24 years at the company, was copy-pasting code from the vendor’s old system into the new API. Worse, the
            database schema was poorly designed: every field was a <code>varchar(255)</code> or <code>text</code>, and
            quote data (including addresses) was stored in a key-value table that created massive duplication.</p>

          <p>For example, a large client with thousands of locations could easily generate tens of thousands of rows
            just to represent addresses. One quote could balloon to ~5MB and slow down the entire system. My first
            recommendation was to normalize addresses into a single row (e.g., using a structured string format), but it
            was met with resistance because “no one on the team had done that before.”</p>

          <p>Despite the technical hurdles, I was assigned the most critical feature: a centralized work area where
            underwriters and agents could view and manage all quotes. This required implementing role-based access
            control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions. Along the way, I gained deep experience with aspect-oriented
            programming and delivered every milestone on schedule.</p>

          <p>But by May, progress had stalled: especially on the frontend. After building strong relationships, I had a
            candid conversation with the lead frontend dev. He admitted he was overwhelmed and secure in his position,
            so deadlines weren’t a priority. Instead of letting that derail the project, I persuaded him to let me take
            over the client implementation for my features. I introduced a component library to replace Shoelace and
            finished the frontend in parallel with my backend work.</p>

          <p>By July, I had completed everything I was brought in to do. The centralized work area was live, access
            control was functioning, and all deliverables were met ahead of schedule. Another happy client and another
            reminder that even the most entrenched projects can be turned around with the right focus and persistence.
          </p>

          <p>After wrapping this up, I decided to launch my own SaaS: <strong>Pelican Journal</strong> and self-host it.
            Unlike the organizations I’ve helped, I’m proving there’s no reason to spend years building an MVP. It's
            going live on <em>September 15, 2025</em>.</p>
